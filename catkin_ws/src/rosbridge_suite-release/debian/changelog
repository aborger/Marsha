  * rosbridge_udp now encodes msg to bytes before send (#537 <https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/issues/537>)
    This is required to work with python3 socket library
  * Conversion between bytes and string (#534 <https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/issues/534>)
    As of python3 sockets will input and output byte strings instead of String objects.
    This commits does the necessary coversions inside the tcp_handler, but it might
    not be the most thoughtful solution but just what I did to make it work with
    python3.

    * Don't pause a finished socket valve
  * Add cbor-raw compression (#452 <https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/issues/452>)
    The CBOR compression is already a huge win over JSON or PNG encoding,
    but it’s still suboptimal in some situations. This PR adds support for
    getting messages in their raw binary (ROS-serialized) format. This has
    benefits in the following cases:
    - Your application already knows how to parse messages in bag files
    (e.g. using [rosbag.js](https://github.com/cruise-automation/rosbag.js),
    which means that now you can use consistent code paths for both bags
    and live messages.
    - You want to parse messages as late as possible, or in parallel, e.g.
    only in the thread or WebWorker that cares about the message. Delaying
    the parsing of the message means that moving or copying the message to
    the thread is cheaper when its in binary form, since no serialization
    between threads is necessary.
    - You only care about part of the message, and don't need to parse the
    rest of it.
    - You really care about performance; no conversion between the ROS
    binary format and CBOR is done in the rosbridge_sever.

    * Add param to enable ws per-message deflate
    Tornado has its own per-message deflate compression option, which
    compresses each WebSocket message.  The compression level should be
    roughly equivalent to PNG compression, depending on whether the message is
    JSON or binary (CBOR).  The encoding/decoding time will be much faster
    than protocol PNG compression.
    This param should be enabled when wire size is important, e.g. not
    connecting to localhost.

  * Fixed the launch files for the tcp and udp service. Without these modifications, the rosapi node fails because some rosparams are not defined properly before. Now the launchfiles comply to the websocket version.
  * Added default topics to all launch files, and fixed bug where it would crash if nothing was put into the lists as values
  * Fix: Set default to publish all topics
    Without better doc, one does not understand why no topics are published. I thought, something is broken.
    With this defaults, everything is working out of the box. And for a more secure setup, one can change it.
  * correct default values for security globs
    also accept empty list as the default "do not check globs" value in addition to None.
    Finally, append rosapi service glob after processing command line input so it's not overwritten
  * add missing imports and correct default values for glob parameters
  * Added services_glob to CallServices, added globs to rosbridge_tcp and rosbridge_udp, and other miscellanous fixes.
  * Two minor fixes.
  * Added new parameters for topic and service security.
    Added 3 new parameters to rosapi and rosbridge_server which filter the
    topics, services, and parameters broadcast by the server to match an
